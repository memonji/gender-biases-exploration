## Project Proposal 
###  Abstract

________

## Contents

In this repository, you will find:

- **Overall_neighbors_comparison:** The script used to extract relevant target words neighbors from pre-built semantic spaces.
  This script has been used to investigate specific words representation in the spaces between diverse languages.
- **Subspaces_creation:** The script used to select specific words lists from the different spaces and extract cosine similarity comparison matrices within them.
  The matrices files are stored as CSV files in the matrices folder.
- **Main:** User interactive script to compute different metrics over the built matrices. Those are:
  - top similarity pairs,
  - most similar words to target ones,
  - heatmaps (stored in /matrices/heatmaps/ folder).
 
### Requirements
The code has been implemented over a Python 3.11.3 and a R 3.6.2 (2019-12-12) version and with a Conda (23.5.2) environment.
