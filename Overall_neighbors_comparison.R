# Description:
# This script aims to be interactive. It is built using the LSAfun package,
# allowing to compute neighbors representation for chosen target words in pre-built semantic spaces.

# Note: 
# Adjust the script parameters, such as directories and functions parameters, as needed for your specific use case.

# Function to compute neighbors over the entire semantic spaces.
# The parameters which you can modify are: 
# target words, number of neighbors, vectorial representation sources.

# Function to graphically plots the neighbors. 
# This can be done with PCA or MDS, in 3 or 2-dimensional representations.
# Target words, number of neighbors and vectorial representation sources can be modified.
